GitHub Pages Deployment Setup - Additional Steps Required

The following items have been completed automatically:
✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
✅ Updated vite.config.ts with base path for GitHub Pages

MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT:

1. REPOSITORY SETUP:
   - Push this code to a GitHub repository
   - Repository name should be 'tacs-frontend' (or update base path in vite.config.ts)
   - Ensure the repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)

2. GITHUB PAGES CONFIGURATION:
   - Go to your repository Settings → Pages
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The deployment workflow will trigger automatically on pushes to master branch

3. REPOSITORY SETTINGS TO VERIFY:
   - Repository → Settings → Actions → General
   - Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected
   - Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"

4. DOMAIN/BASE PATH CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Current base path is set to '/tacs-frontend/'
   - If your repository name differs, update the base path in vite.config.ts
   - For custom domain: add CNAME file to public/ directory

5. FIRST DEPLOYMENT:
   - Push code to master branch
   - Check Actions tab for workflow progress
   - Site will be available at: https://[username].github.io/tacs-frontend/

6. OPTIONAL OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Enable branch protection rules for master branch
   - Set up environment protection rules in Settings → Environments → github-pages
   - Consider adding preview deployments for pull requests

7. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - If build fails, check Actions logs
   - Ensure all dependencies in package.json are available
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility (currently set to 18)
   - Check for any hardcoded localhost URLs in the code

The website is now ready for GitHub Pages deployment once pushed to a GitHub repository with the above settings configured.
